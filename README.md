Hi!

This is the wintersonneDev repo. I am a hobby-developer from Germany. Tools made here are mostly out of private interest. I'll try to post some public repos that are of some kind of
use to some users (or more ðŸ˜‰).

I am not very experienced as I have not studied an software engineering. Everything I do here has been gained through learning by doing and/or some online courses in my freetime.

Languages/stuff I have done until now:
- HTML, CSS
- Javascript
- Nodejs
- PHP
- C#
- Python
- ...
